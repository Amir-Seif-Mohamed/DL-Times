Tensor:

The central unit of data in Tensorflow. A tensor consist of a set of primitive value shaped into an array of any number of dimensions.

These primitive value can be char, int, float or any other.

Single valued data is referred to as 0-D data or 'scalars'
One dimensions data is said to as 1-D tensors or 'Vectors'
Two dimensions data is said to as 2-D tensors or 'Matrices'
Multi - dimensional data is said to as N-D tensors or 'N-dimensional matrices'


Characterization of Tensors:

1. Rank - The number of dimensions in a tensor.
2. Shape - The number of elements in each dimensions.
3. Data Type - The data type of each element in the tensor.


For knowing rank of tensor use tf.rank(tensor) to know the rank of the tensor.
