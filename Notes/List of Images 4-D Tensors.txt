List of Images 4-D Tensors

Tensor flow can also deal with list of images which can be referred as 4-D tensors.

For representing images as one tensor of 4-D, all images needs to be of same size.
A list of images where every images have different number of channels and different measurement cannot be represented as a 4-D Tensors.

List of images in a 4-D Tensor can typically be represented as

(n,x,y,c)

n - number of Images
x - length of image
y - width of image
c - number of channels
