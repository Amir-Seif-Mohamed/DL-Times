Tensor FLow Basic Steps:

#import the library
import tensorflow as tf

#making constants
hello = tf.constant('Hello, Welcome to world of tensorflow.')

#creating a session object
sess = tf.Session()

#printing the tensor
print(sess.run(hello))

For visualisation in tensorflow using tensorboard do as :
writer = tf.summary.FieldWriter(<name of the directoryto store logs>, <what to store>)
e.g.,
writer = tf.summary.FieldWriter('./example', sess.graph)

and to view that graph from terminal run the following command

tensorboard --logdir='./example'

and then it will gives a url where we can view the entire computation graph

Tensor flow computation are done in two Steps:
1. Building up a graph
2. Calculate only those parts which are of your interest

This gives us an advantage
Multiple portions of graph can be run in parallel accross machine in cluster.
